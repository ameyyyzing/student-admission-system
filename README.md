# Student Admission System

A simple Java application built using a layered architecture to simulate student admission processes. This project demonstrates the use of Java interfaces, classes, and a basic implementation of repository and service layers.

---

## 🌟 Features
- **Layered Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (Model, Repository, Service, Main).
- **Stub Implementation**: Simulates a database for educational purposes.
- **OOP Principles**: Showcases the use of interfaces, encapsulation, and abstraction.
